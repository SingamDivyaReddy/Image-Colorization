# 🎨 Image Colorization

A web-based application that transforms black-and-white images into realistic colorized versions using deep learning. The project includes a modern **React + TypeScript** frontend and a **Python Flask** backend with machine learning capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 **Automatic Image Colorization**: Upload grayscale images and get vibrant colorized outputs  
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Built with React and TypeScript  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Processing**: Fast image processing and instant results  
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Backend**: Neural networks ensure accurate color restoration  
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SingamDivyaReddy/Image-Colorization.git
cd Image-Colorization
```

---

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

➡️ Backend runs on: `http://localhost:5000`

---

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup (New Terminal)

## 🖥️ Usage Guide

1. 🔧 Start the backend  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. 🚀 Start the frontend  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. 🌐 Open in browser  
   Visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

4. 🖼️ Upload an image  
   Choose any black-and-white image

5. 🎨 View results  
   The colorized image will be displayed after processing

## 🔧 Available Scripts

### Frontend

```bash
npm install         # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Create production build
npm run preview     # Preview production build
```

### Backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install Python packages
python app.py                    # Start Flask server
```

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Image Upload** – User selects a grayscale image  
2. **Server Processing** – Image sent to Flask backend  
3. **Deep Learning Inference** – Model predicts and restores color  
4. **Result Delivery** – Colorized image is returned and shown in the UI
